# Onfido Capture SDK for Android: Example app

This repository contains code for an Android application intended to showcase the [Onfido Android SDK](https://github.com/onfido/onfido-android-sdk).

This APK has two launcher apps. One is a demo flow that emulates a banking app, the other is an app that allows you to test different SDK configurations.

You need an Onfido account and API token to use the sample app. Please contact us through our [website](https://onfido.com/signup) to create an Onfido account.

Create a file called `secrets` in the root of the project and place the API token inside it as follows:
```
onfido_api_token=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```
